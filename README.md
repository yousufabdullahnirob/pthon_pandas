# Python Pandas Learning

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for learning and demonstrating Pandas functionality.

## Contents

- **Joining Data**: Examples of merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames.
- **Reshaping**: Examples of `melt`, `pivot`, and `pivot_table`.
- **Grouping**: Examples of `groupby` operations.

## Key Files

- `joining/melt.ipynb`: Demonstrates how to use `pd.melt` to unpivot a DataFrame from wide to long format.
- `joining/pivot.ipynb`: Demonstrates how to use `pivot_table` (since `pivot` doesn't support margins).

## formatting

The code follows standard Python practices and uses Jupyter Notebooks for interactive execution.
